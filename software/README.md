# **SoftSnap Simulation: Forward & Inverse Kinematics**  

## 🏗️ Overview  
This folder contains **Jupyter Notebooks** for simulating SoftSnap’s deformation behavior using **forward and inverse kinematics**. These simulations help visualize how the modular soft robot bends and actuates under different control inputs.

---

## 📂 Files in this Folder  
- `forward_simulation.ipynb` → Simulates how SoftSnap deforms given motor actuation inputs (forward kinematics).  
- `inverse_simulation.ipynb` → Computes the required control inputs to achieve a desired deformation (inverse kinematics).  

---

## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**  
To run the simulations, you need **Python 3.x** and Jupyter Notebook installed.
